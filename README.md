# Work Experience

# Project Manager & Senior Software Engineer
## IT Project Lead/Coordinator • December 2024 – Present • Freelance • India • Overseas 

### Working as freelancer on certain project which are contractual and time bound. Working with cross platform teams. 
### End-to-End Project Ownership I am for the entire project lifecycle—from gathering client requirements and planning timelines to writing code and deploying the application. This means balancing strategic thinking with hands-on development, ensuring both the vision and execution are aligned.
### Technical Architecture & Stack Decision choosing the best tools and frameworks (e.g., Python + FastAPI/Django, PostgreSQL, or Firebase for mobile backends), ensuring the architecture supports cross-platform functionality. This means I need to justify these choices to the client or stakeholders in a clear, non-technical way.
### Acted as a key liaison between PMO and technology teams—leading requirement elicitation, estimating effort, assigning tasks, and ensuring delivery of high-quality systems on schedule.
### Oversaw the development and deployment of web-based enterprise applications, ensuring solutions aligned with user expectations and business goals.
### Client communication & Reporting as the main point of contact, keeping clients updated on progress, blockers, and changes. This includes writing weekly status reports, presenting demos, and managing expectations on scope, budget, or timelines. And sharing KPIs along with updates on the management software like Jira, Azure boards and Monday.com.
### Collaborated across teams to drive project success, ensuring that collective goals were met by fostering a cooperative and communicative environment.
### Hands-On Development & Problem Solving, in addition to managing, I actively need to overview coding, debugging, and integrating APIs or systems. I need to quickly switch between writing Python code (if necessary), managing backend infrastructure, and supporting mobile/web integration needs.
### Testing, launch and Post-Release Support I need to oversee quality assurance while also participating in it—writing tests, running UAT sessions, and handling bug fixes because sometimes clients are not able to afford project cost and want us to deliberately help them, which we do. After launch, if client has any maintenance contract signed, I need to coordinate and handle updates, user feedback, and quick hotfixes, making my availability and responsiveness critical.
